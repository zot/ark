# LuhmannCLI
**Requirements:** R2791, R2792, R2793, R2794, R2795, R2796, R2861, R3010, R3011, R3012, R3013, R3014, R3015, R3016, R3017, R3018, R3019, R3026, R3036

The Go surface the orchestrator session calls into. Three verbs record
its own supervisor lifecycle into `~/.ark/monitoring/luhmann.jsonl` —
`spawn-record` and `exit-record` are server-required (they route through
the write actor); `inspect-exit` is cold-start (it only reads subagent
JSONLs). A fourth verb, **`next`**, is the orchestrator's blocking
**drain tube**: it hands back curation tasks, supervisor directives, and
keepalives from the recall service, guarded by an in-memory ownership
lease that keeps exactly one Luhmann draining (R3010–R3016).

The orchestrator session itself — the persona, the supervisor logic,
the Task-spawning of managed subagents — lives in a Claude Code
skill (`.claude/skills/luhmann.md`) and is **not** Go code. This
card covers only the Go surface the skill calls into.

## Knows
- arkDir: string — `~/.ark/`
- logPath: string — `~/.ark/monitoring/luhmann.jsonl`
- luhmannOwner: string — the session that currently holds the
  Luhmann role (R3012). In-memory server state, empty when
  unowned; cleared on a server restart (no persistence). The
  ownership lease `next` enforces.
- nextQueue: chan work — in-memory queue of work items the recall
  watcher pushes and `next` drains (R3011): curation tasks (a
  request-doc path to refine) and supervisor directives (stand up /
  stop a pool secretary). Server state; a bounce drops it.

## Does

### `luhmann spawn-record --class C --nonce N --task-id T`
- Server-required. All three flags are required; missing-flag exit
  is non-zero before any state change.
- Read the existing log tail to find the most recent record for
  the named class. `crashes` and `quit_early` both carry forward
  from that record's fields (or `0` if no prior record exists). (R2861)
- Append one record:
  ```
  {ts: now, kind: "spawn", class: C, nonce: N, task_id: T,
   reason: "", crashes: <carried>, quit_early: <carried>, backoff: 0}
  ```
  via the write actor. (R2794)

### `luhmann exit-record --class C --nonce N --reason R [--crashes K] [--quit-early K]`
- Server-required. `--class`, `--nonce`, `--reason` required.
- Look at the tail to find the previous record for this class and
  read both `crashes` and `quit_early`. Reason → kind, then
  recompute both counters (R2795, R2861):
  - `context-limit` → kind `exit`; `crashes := 0`, `quit_early := 0`
    (a healthy recycle is a success — resets both).
  - `quit-early` → kind `quit-early`; `quit_early := prev + 1`,
    `crashes := prev` (held).
  - any other reason → kind `crash`; `crashes := prev + 1`,
    `quit_early := prev` (held).
  - `--crashes K` / `--quit-early K` override the respective
    computed value when the caller has already classified.
- Append one record:
  ```
  {ts: now, kind: <"exit"|"quit-early"|"crash">, class: C, nonce: N,
   task_id: "", reason: R, crashes: <computed>,
   quit_early: <computed>, backoff: <see below>}
  ```
  For `crash`, `backoff` is the seconds the supervisor will wait
  before respawn (orchestrator chooses, passes as `--backoff`).
  For `exit` and `quit-early`, `backoff` is zero. (R2795)

### `luhmann inspect-exit --nonce N [--json]`
- Cold-start.
- Reuse the nonce → `.meta.json` discovery from R2760
  (`discoverSubagentJSONL(nonce)`). On lookup failure, label is
  `unknown`.
- Read the subagent's JSONL backwards. Classify (R2796):
  - **healthy** requires `tokens_at_close` (the R2777 value) at or
    over `[luhmann].context_limit` — the generation filled and
    recycled as designed. With `ark connections recall next` the
    only clean exit is its context-gate directive, so a real
    recycle always reaches the limit.
  - **quit-early** when the most recent record is a clean turn
    boundary (a `tool_result` for `ark connections recall next` /
    `close`, or a `recall.jsonl` outcome ∈ {`result-emitted`,
    `silent-close`, `no-subscriber`}) but `tokens_at_close` is
    *below* the limit — the agent stopped before filling. The
    orchestrator respawns it (fresh nonce) like a healthy exit but
    does not count it as a crash; the distinct label keeps the early
    stop visible instead of masquerading as healthy.
  - **crash** when the most recent record is an error tail
    (`isError: true`) or the JSONL ends mid-turn (last record is
    not a complete tool_result / assistant turn).
  - **unknown** when the JSONL is empty or discovery failed.
- Default output: the label string on stdout. `--json`: object
  with `label`, `last_record_kind` (e.g. `tool_result`, `assistant`,
  `user`), `last_error` (string or null), and `tokens_at_close`
  (the R2777 value, or `0` when unmeasured).

### `luhmann next --session S [--first|--force] [--keepalive N]`
- Server-required. The orchestrator's **drain tube**: a blocking
  long-poll that returns one work item and is re-invoked in a loop
  (R3010). The Luhmann skill backgrounds it so the session stays
  conversational; on completion the harness re-injects the result,
  Luhmann acts, and re-invokes. Same background-lotto-tube family as
  `RecallNext` and `{cmd} event`.
- **Ownership lease** (R3012): `--session S` is an *identity*, not a
  tube scope — the queue is one global feed of all CLI hunts and
  directives, and a single `luhmannOwner` holds the role.
  - **`--first`** claims: sets `luhmannOwner := S` if unowned; if a
    *different* session owns it, errors `you don't have ownership`
    (R3013).
  - **plain** (no flag) validates and **never claims**: proceeds only
    if `S == luhmannOwner`; errors `there are no sessions` when
    unowned, `you don't have ownership` when a different session owns
    it (R3013).
  - **`--force`** sets `luhmannOwner := S` unconditionally — the
    deliberate takeover of a dead-but-registered owner (R3013).
  - The lease is **in-memory**, so a bounce clears it. The two error
    strings drive the skill's reflexes and make the protocol
    self-converging with no persistence (R3014): `there are no
    sessions` → re-invoke `--first`; `you don't have ownership` →
    **exit** (a losing second Luhmann steps down after a post-bounce
    race, so exactly one survives).
- **Blocks** up to the keepalive window (`--keepalive N`, default
  ~45 min; R3016) in a select over `nextQueue`, the keepalive timer,
  and ctx. On an item it returns crank-handle prose; on the deadline a
  keepalive (run next again). Three kinds (R3011): a **curation task**
  (the request doc's content is **inlined** into the crank-handle — a
  `tmp://` path is not a Read-able file — and the skill refines it, then
  runs `ark bloodhound add … --loc … --note …` per kept item and a
  terminal `add … --done`, naming the request-doc path only as the
  `--result` arg, R3025/R3027); a **supervisor directive** (stand up /
  stop a pool secretary — the skill spawns/stops via Task and records
  with `spawn-record` / `exit-record`, R3019); the **keepalive**.
- **Re-launch-first** (R3036): every *work* crank handle (curation,
  directive) LEADS with the instruction to fire the successor `next`
  (backgrounded) **before** processing the item (`relaunchFirst`),
  replacing the old trailing "run next again". Loop continuity thus
  moves from tail to front, so a mid-work drift or a garbled tool call
  can't kill the loop — the successor is already blocking. The keepalive
  already re-launches and is unchanged; the `/luhmann` skill teaches the
  same order.
- **Stubborn plumbing** (R3015): the `next` CLI treats an `ark serve`
  bounce as a wait condition — redials with backoff, and on reconnect
  a `there are no sessions` routes into the re-`--first` path rather
  than failing the loop (mirrors `RecallNext`'s R2903 redial).
- The keepalive is a **backgrounded-loop** clock (< 1 hr main-agent
  cache), NOT the secretary's 90 s foreground number (R3016); the tube
  **subsumes** the standalone `ark heartbeat` design.

### Pool lifecycle + curation opt-in (R3017–R3019, R3026)
- The **CLI-bloodhound secretary pool** is a Luhmann-managed class
  (R3019): on stand-up / stop directives the skill spawns / stops pool
  secretaries and records them on the same crash / quit-early streak
  machine and `[luhmann]` policy the recall class once used. Config:
  `class.bloodhound.pool_max` (default 3, R3017) and
  `class.bloodhound.cooldown_seconds` (default 120, R3018) — read from
  `[luhmann]` on the same reload path (R2801).
- Luhmann's **opt-in to serve CLI curation is simply owning the `next`
  seat** (R3026): no separate parent-signal subscription; a session not
  draining `next` serves no CLI hunts. Curation is mandatory but
  decoupled from occupancy — the watcher already freed the secretary on
  its return (R3024), so a slow refine costs only the CLI's latency.

## Collaborators
- Monitor (crc-Monitor.md): reads back the log this card writes.
- RecallAgentBuilder (crc-RecallAgentBuilder.md): provides the
  `discoverSubagentJSONL` helper (R2760) and the same `.meta.json`
  scanning behavior; LuhmannCLI calls into it for `inspect-exit`.
  No new lookup code on this card.
- Server (crc-Server.md): hosts the HTTP handlers for the two
  write-actor verbs, and the `next` long-poll endpoint + the
  `luhmannOwner` / `nextQueue` state.
- CLI (crc-CLI.md): dispatches the four subcommands.
- RecallWatcher (crc-RecallWatcher.md): the Fixer that **pushes**
  curation tasks (on a hunt's return) and supervisor directives
  (pool scaling) onto `nextQueue`; `next` drains what the watcher
  enqueues (R3011, R3024).
