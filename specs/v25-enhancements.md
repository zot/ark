# V2.5 Enhancements: Glob Sources, Strategy Mapping, File Logging

## Glob Sources

Config is intent, the database is state. Source directories in
ark.toml can be glob patterns — `~/.claude/projects/*/memory` means
"every project memory directory." The glob is a directive: it says
what *should* exist. The database only ever contains concrete
directories.

`ark sources check` is a lightweight reconciliation command. It
expands globs from config, diffs against what's already in the
database. New directories are added as sources. Directories that
no longer exist are flagged as MIA. No file scanning or indexing
happens — just directory listing against glob patterns. Cheap enough
to run on every `ark serve` startup.

A concrete source that was created by a glob cannot be removed
directly — that's an error ("managed by glob pattern X"). To change
what a glob manages, change the glob in ark.toml. When a glob is
removed from config, its formerly-resolved sources become orphans.
`ark sources check` detects and reports orphans for cleanup.

Glob expansion uses Go's `filepath.Glob` after `~` expansion on
each pattern.

### CLI

- `ark sources check` — expand globs, report new/MIA/orphan
  directories. Output is human-readable: lines like
  `+ /home/deck/.claude/projects/-foo/memory` (new),
  `- /home/deck/.claude/projects/-gone/memory` (MIA),
  `? /home/deck/old-notes` (orphan — no glob owns it).
  New sources are added to config automatically.
  MIA sources are flagged but not removed.
- `ark config add-source` accepts glob patterns. If the dir contains
  glob characters (`*`, `?`, `[`), it's stored as a glob source
  instead of validated with os.Stat.

### Config Format

```toml
# Concrete source
[[source]]
dir = "~/work/daneel"
strategy = "lines"
include = ["*.md"]

# Glob source — expands to multiple concrete sources
[[source]]
dir = "~/.claude/projects/*/memory"
strategy = "markdown"
```

No separate `[[glob_source]]` table. A source with glob characters
in its `dir` is a glob source. Keeps the config format flat and
simple.

### Server API

- `POST /config/sources-check` — run glob reconciliation, return
  JSON with new/MIA/orphan arrays

## Global Strategy Mapping

A top-level `strategies` table in ark.toml maps file glob patterns
to chunking strategy names. When scanning, the scanner checks each
file against the strategy map before falling back to the source's
default strategy.

Longest pattern wins — `docs/**/*.md` beats `*.md` because it's more
specific. Pattern length (in characters) is the tiebreaker. This is
poor-man's specificity: simple, predictable, no CSS-style priority
rules.

### Config Format

```toml
[strategies]
"*.md" = "markdown"
"*.jsonl" = "chat-jsonl"
"docs/**/*.md" = "markdown"
```

### Behavior

- During scan, for each file: check strategies map (longest match
  wins), then fall back to the source's `strategy` field
- The source `strategy` field remains the default for files that
  don't match any global pattern
- Strategy names must be registered in microfts2 — error at scan
  time if a strategy name is unknown

## File Logging

The server logs to `~/.ark/logs/ark.log` in addition to stderr.
CLI commands that cold-start do not log to file — only the
long-running server needs persistent logs.

### Behavior

- Server creates `~/.ark/logs/` directory on startup if it doesn't
  exist
- Uses Go's `log.SetOutput` with an `io.MultiWriter` for both
  stderr and the log file
- Simple size cap: on startup, if the log file exceeds 10MB,
  truncate it (keep the last 1MB). No rotation, no external
  dependencies.
- Log format is Go's default: date time message
